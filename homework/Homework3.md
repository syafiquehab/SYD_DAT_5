# SYD DAT 5 Lab 2 - Visualisation and Regression

##Homework - Due July 25th 2016

* For the following, continue to use the github repository you made for your project
* You don't have to use the same data that you used from the previous homework assignment if
  you have decided to change what your project is about.
* Identify some attributes where you would expect clustering to be successful.
* Try two or more different clustering algorithms, and experiment with
  different numbers of clusters.
* If the clustering works well, try to give descriptive names for the
  different clusters you have found. If the clustering isn't
  successful, try to hypothesise why your data is some homogenous (and
  try clustering on different attributes).
* Try building decision trees on your data. If you think simplicity
  would be good, try to make it as simple as possible. If you think
  accuracy is more important, use ensembling or any other techniques
  that you have learned.
* Modify one of the models you have created so that you can evaluate
  its bias-variance trade-off. (You can use one of the models from the
  previous homework assignment if you think that looks more
  interesting.)
