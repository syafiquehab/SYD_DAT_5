5 key points I took from the article:

1. Data BusinessPeople most likely to have an MBA, at nearly 25%
2. Data Scientists should work in teams with overlapping skills to be most effective
3. In order to gain a valuable breadth of skills and points of view, a Data Scientist would be better served by being rotated periodically.
4. There are still so many misinterpretation about Data Scientists role that needs to be addressed as there are different types of Data Scientists
5. Different types of Data Scientists have different type of skills and it doesnt reflect the idea of T-shaped Data Scientist.


Summary of a chapter from Data Science Handbook:

Riley Newman – Chief Data Scientist at Airbnb
A self-made guy who made his way through college by being part of US Coast Guard and not the typical data scientist as he is one of the few who possessed the economic background. He had been called by the US Coast Guard to serve after he finished his master’s. After he finished his obligation, he worked for a few years in economics consulting for the technical training. After working intensively for 3 years, he is looking for a way out and then he accidentally meet with the founders of Airbnb and ended up joining as one of the early employees where he confessed that he is finally excited about helping to build something and see the impact of this. 
He is of the believe that Data Science will become less technical in the future, so much that we don’t even need to analyse the data, the insights are there just waiting for us. But he doesn’t think that it will be completely automated as good data science is more about the questions we pose the data rather than data mungling and analysis. 

Project Idea:
1. Goals: Use Adwords and online sales data to reach more profitable customers, segment profitable customer, factors of good campaign.
Approach: 
a) Evaluate user's search behaviour and historical revenue data to better assign value to every click
b) Which campaigns are useless and which aren't?
c) What are the factors of good adwords campaign?
d) What are the profitable customers?
e) How customers are searching for product?

So, finding correlation between first action done by users and higher retention.
Possibly using email clustering to find out which email campaign works best? and find out which adwords campaign lead to useless signup and which that leads to sales?
What are the possible factors that would lead to useless signup?

2. Predicting which soccer player to sign based on their on-field performances (goals, assists, key passes, tackles, interception, injury records, etc) and at realistic price and salary.
There are plenty of data regarding player's performance at Transfrmarket website and also its salaries and their price.
