* I couldn't find the coding section of your homework.

Looking at your project ideas:

* Seeing how the probability of a country winning a medal in an event
  changed over time could be quite interesting. The data is relatively
  easy to get hold of too.

* I'm not sure where you will get the data for your book project.

* The flight information one looks good: it looks like Google have an
  API (QPX Express) that you could use to collect data.

* The salary one is unlikely to work: I'm not sure you'll be able to
  get sufficient data to say much more than "professionals earn more
  than labourers"

* I think the weather project won't be hard enough or interesting
  enough: tourism Australia maintain that sort of information.
