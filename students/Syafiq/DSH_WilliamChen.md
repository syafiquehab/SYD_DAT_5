====================================

# Who is William Chen?

# Summary on his chapter:
* Data Science is distilling the data into actionable insights to improve product and business
* As Data Scientist, 80% of the time is spent pulling the data, cleaning the data and writing the code for your analysis - often doesn't require any statistics knowledge.
* However, a strong background in math and statistics is still important to gather the intuition you need to distinguish real insights from fake insights.
* Strong statistics and math background would give good contribution to communication - the better you understand the theory, the better you can articulate what you're doing.
* Programming is vital in data science.
* Data Science is overhyped but doesn't mean it's not important - they hype will die down in few years but the importance will not.
* Why he chose data science over quantitative science? - For tech, data is very new, while for finance, data is very old. He prefer to be part where data was just getting a foothold.
