    "\n",
    "#### Setup (Done) \n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.  (Done)\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo (Done) \n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!) (Done) \n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics. (Done) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication \n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Key Point 1\n",
    "There are four types of data scientist. \n",
    "   •\tData Business People,\n",
    "Data Business People are more focused on the organization and how data projects yield profit. Like a business management consultant. Usually have a business management degree. \n",
    "   •\tData Creatives, \n",
    "Often tackle the entire soup-to-nuts analytics process on their own – excel at applying a wide range of tools and technologies to a problem. Like hacker or hacking artist. Commonly have undergraduate degrees in Economics and Statistics. \n",
    "   •\tData Developers\n",
    "Focused on technical problem of managing data – how to get it, store it and learn from it. Like a data engineer who would write code and develop the product. Usually have a computer science degree or computer engineering degree. \n",
    "   •\tData Researcher\n",
    "Academic research in the physical or social sciences, or in statistics with the data. Nearly 75% have published in peer-reviewed journals and over half have a PhD degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Key Point 2\n",
    "Data Scientist is a very generic word, similar to simply 'doctor', 'lawyer' etc. A specific type of data scientist should be identified to suit specific problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Key Point 3\n",
    "Many company looks for the title of data scientist but the job requirement doesn’t align the skills of a data scientist. Fail to communicate clearly the role’s required skills, costing both candidate and company time and expenses. People without clear understanding of data scientist would expect God-like capability. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Key Point 4.\n",
    "There are 22 generic skills spanned the range of useful things data scientist might do as below. \n",
    "data scientist's skills: ![whatever](data_skills.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Key Point 5 \n",
    "Not all data people work with data size above Gigabytes-level. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Key Point 6 \n",
    "\n",
    "What a data scientist can do within a large organization include: \n",
    "1. Personalization model for product \n",
    "2. Controlled experiments for a marketing group\n",
    "3. Forecasting for finance group \n",
    "4. Process optimization for operation group \n",
    "\n",
    "question \n",

    "Michalangelo D’Agostino – The Election as Physical Science \n",
    "\n",
    "###### What Michalangelo D’Agostino has done in the past and what’s he doing now? \n",
    "Prior to working in data science, Michelangelo was an undergrad at Harvard in physics. He finished his PhD in astrophysics. He started his data science career as a senior analyst in digital analytics with the 2012 Obama re-election campaign where he assisted in optimizing the campaign’s email fundraising efforts and analysed social media data. Afterwards, he worked as Lead Data Scientist at Braintree before he re-joined many of his former colleagues from the Obama re-election team at Civis Analytics. At Civis Analytics, Michelangelo works on\n",
    "statistical models and writes software for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Michalangelo’s first experience in apply data science technique in physical science. \n",
    "\n",
    "He was doing a neutrino physics experiment called IceCube in South Pole. The experiment involved burying sensors to measure cosmic neutrinos. Data Science came in as a method to determine what’s signal and what is background in terms of the collected measurement. He used a lot of neural networks to do pattern recognition for a particular kind of neutrino signal in the detector that was relevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Michalangelo’s involvement and contribution for the Obama’s re-election campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key realization from him was that his work was not dissimilar to the things he was doing in physics. He spent lot of time in writing Python code to grab data from APIs or to scrape data, similar to writing data acquisition code in physics. Instead of particle physics models, I was building statistical models, predictive models to predict how much money a fundraising email was going to make from its early returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Michalangelo’s advice to graduate and PhD students about transition into doing data science work in a non-academic organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grad School and PhD degree provided a good environment in training someone’s ability to handle challenging problems and develop emotional strength to tackle these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "About transition into non-academic field, the advice included: \n",
    " -\tto recognize the skills and experience that one has from their grad school or PhD program. Examples include works that demonstrate that one can work on problems outside your academic specialty, and show that one really has the initiative.\n",
    " -\tThe job market in academic research in physics is challenging. \n",
    " -\tThere are many different types of data science jobs from commercial organization. It’s important to clarify the actual expectation from the company and understand their current organizational structure in working data-related tasks. \n",
    " -\tOrganization has a large amount of data but this data is not necessarily being used effectively. They are seeking people with data science skills to carry out the work.   \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Michalangelo’s opinion on data science’s progress in public relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many resources and online media effort being put into inform and educating people about the work, techniques and project involved in data science. It’s positive. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Michalangelo’s thoughts on the hype of data science\n",
    "\n",
    "He is worried that data science is being hyped up right now. I think that trend is going to continue, and organization is going to want people to help them analyze that data. All the hype has not just been around data science but about tools. The term big data has become an overused, overhyped thing. To him, it’s not about the amount of data but what to do with the data and how to apply it to problems and what interesting things could be done.That’s so much more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills Data scientist needs to do that just don’t come from a single discipline like statistics or computer science. Data scientists should have all the interdisciplinary aspects of what people call data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming (Done) \n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idea 1: to find great-value real estate properties to buy, live and raise a family based on people’s criteria \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to develop search algorithm to identify real estate properties that are of the best value to buy, live and raise a family based on people’s criteria \n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Off the top of my head, people usually care about the followings when making a decision about buying a house to live and raise a family:\n",
    "-\tType of real estate properties \n",
    "-\tPrice \n",
    "-\tBedroom numbers \n",
    "-\tCar space \n",
    "-\tTotal space or areas of the properties \n",

    "-\tDistance proximity to shop, school, public transportation and popular leisure spots \n",
    "-\tNeighbourhood characteristic e.g noise, safety \n",
    "-\tPotential financial gain potential  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure I don’t miss out on any other key factors, a search for understanding the sentimental factor is required. These factors should be rated with a score in percentage with input from users to rank these factors and find their most desired property. \n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest challenge would be gathering the data and formatting them. \n",
    "\n",
    "After gathering all necessary data, develop the algorithm to give out properties in a report format with the best score based on user inputs. Visualization of the data and in-depth data exploration would be involved to work on the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Idea 2: Bottom-up Analytical Study into the relevance between real estate (RE) price movement and the driving factors & development of future RE pricing predictive model \n",
    "\n",
    "With the dataset of all real estate property transaction within NSW in the past 5 years, it would seem possible to bypass the factor-to-result analysis but reverse the process by studying the transaction data with a statistic approach to find any interesting property transaction patterns. If interesting patterns are found, we could identify the timing of these patterns and find the connection with the actions in the real world. Hopefully it could lead to a fact-based relationship between the driving factors and the real estate property price. Ideally it’s to develop a 2-D relationship between the price and each factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "These driving factors would be used as the dependant variables and train the sales data to develop a predictive model for predicting the future real estate price. The integrity of the predictive model would be tested and verified by future sales data or dataset of other region’s real estate transaction.  \n",

    "#### Idea 3: predicting electricity infrastructure service provider’s spending in power transformers \n",
    "\n",
    "Power transformers are electrical equipment used to perform electricity voltage step-up or step down within the electricity grid. They are installed in a substation and many of them are connected in the National Electricity Grid in Australia to form a national electricity network. Electricity passes through these transformers in a form of electrical energy, placing electrical stress to these transformers. The amount of electricity passing through these transformers can be measured by electricity demand on these nodes as per unit MVA. As demand increases and approach the capacity of existing transformers, the need to purchase and install new transformer become a reality to avoid overloading and cause potential electrical failure in the network. When electrical failure occurs to transformers, the connected electricity network would not provide electricity to the places that require electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "By studying the current capacity of transformers within a particularly electricity network and the peak demand of the network, we could assess the adequacy of the current transformers capacity. By predicting the future demand and its behaviour within a network, we could predict the future purchasing needs of new power transformers from the network operator.   \n",

    "\n",
    "With the availability of traffic volume data of Sydney from www.rms.nsw.gov.au and the real estate price data, it would seem possible to identify the best valued commercial real estate with the most vehicle traffic to open up a business that could serve the people driving passing through the spot. \n",
