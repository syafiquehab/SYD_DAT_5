Summary
-------

I have read the Chapter 13. The Interplay Between Science, Engineering and Data Science which presents the interview from DIANE WU Data Scientist at Palantir when the interview was conducted. Following were key observations which I find were key based on my personal experience:

1. There is confusion regarding the terminology associated with Data Science, resulting in expectation gap. Considering in one role as DATA Scientist one could be helping build the solution but in other role they might work as analyst to help determine the Solution requirement to determine feature requirement.
2. Considering the hype around Data Science, the organizations / customer consider Data Scientist as silver bullet point i.e. solution to all problem without having realistic idea about the effort and requirement for same.
3. Also, assuming Data Science is only applicable to very large amount of data is not necessary true as Data Science can be applied to few MB and GB's of data as well.
4. Data Science application requirement can change from static data sets to streaming datasets based on requirement.
5. Data Science should not be looked from number crunching or solution building point of view only as it is important to have good communication to ask right question and discover use cases. Similarly, one should be able to present the findings in effective way using visualization 

As rightly pointed in the interview chapter, instead of looking Data Science as isolated branch in itself, it requires multiple skill and ideally organization should look to build team with overlapping skills to deliver the required outcome. To be a good data scientist one has to have 

Most importantly as Data Scientist one should be able to create value from the data.
