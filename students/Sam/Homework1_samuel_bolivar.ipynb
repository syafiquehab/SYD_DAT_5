    "\n",
    "##Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "    ##### 5 Key Points\n",
    "        * Excessive hype leads people to expect miracles, and miracle workers; and lack of awareness about the variety of data scientists leads organizations to waste effort when trying to find talent.\n",
    "        * Data Businesspeople are those that are more fosucd on the organization and how data projects yield profit.\n",
    "        * Data Creatives are the broadest of data scientists.\n",
    "        * Data Developers are people focused on the technical problem of managind Data.\n",
    "        * Data Researchers mostly come from academic researhc in the physical or social sciences or in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "    ##### Done\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a summary of a chapter of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "    ##### Summary of 2nd capter of the Data Science Handbook\n",
    "        * Five years is a long time. If you think back five years, data science barely existed, and it’s still evolving rapidly\n",
    "        * I do believe that data gives people the power to make better decisions, so the more people who have access to it, the better.\n",
    "        * A data scientist is someone who sits down with a question and gathers some data to answer it, or someone who starts with a data set and asks questions to learn more about it. They do some math, write some code, do the analysis, and then come to a conclusion\n",
    "        * Creating a story that’s compelling and exciting for people, while still respecting the truth of the data, is hard to do\n",
    "        * It’s like art. You’re trying to take a really intense emotion or complex phenomenon and express it in a way that people will understand intuitively.\n",
    "        * I want to know that they’re capable of thinking about what the data set is and coming up with ideas on their own for what they would like to see\n",
    "        * Another question I ask sometimes is, what is the most evil thing that could be done with this?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "        #### Done\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "      Work with one of the following data sets\n",
    "          * History of Baseball data set and answer the questions suggested on Kaggle\n",
    "          * How ISIS Uses Twitter\n",
    "          * Work with IMDB and Movie Lens data\n",
    "          * Speed Dating Experiment\n",
    "          * Brain imaging data (fMRI)\n",
    "      \n",
    "  * What data you will use, and how you will collect it\n",
    "      * Kaggle\n",
    "      * IMDB and Movie Lens\n",
    "      \n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "      * I am trying to predict behaviour or answer predicitve type questions.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "      * No ideas yet of modelling techniques involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account and create a pull request so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Fork, Clone, Commit, Push and Pull request.**"
