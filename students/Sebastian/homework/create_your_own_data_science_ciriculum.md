## Creating your own data science currriculum.

This is a summary of the chapter "Creating your own data science curriculum" by Clare Corthell, a data scientist at Mattermark, from the data science handbook. The chapter describes how Clare went about teaching her self to become a data scientist. Rescources are available on her [Github Repo](https://github.com/datasciencemasters).

* Clare was motivated by how data could be used to make informed decisions in product design.
* She created the Open Source Data Masters, a collection of open-source resources, while teaching herself data science. The repository was put together because of her motivation to learn data science without pursuing a 3 year Masters degree in the subject.
* Several resources were important: Quora, a Q and A website with a large data science community, Blogs (esp Ziplan Data Science Bootcamp Blog), Cousera Courses, a book called "Programming Collective Intelligence".
* One doesn't have to be an expert in maths to be a data scientist. (See Analyzing the Analyzers for more on skills in data science.)
* It took a leap of faith to leave her field and self teach herself another. It is especially hard to tell if people will value your skills. Some didn't, especially recruiters, but there were still opportunities with people willing to invest in potential and the ability to hit the ground running, such as at startups.
* It takes discipline. Clare likened her self study to letting a 6 year old into the library without supervision; you don't know what will happen, the child may pull all the books down or just stare out the window. It takes discipline to follow this self directed course.
* The value of self directed study is increasing. There are opportunities if you possess the initiative to acquire the right skills for data science.
