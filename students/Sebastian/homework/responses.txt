* It looks like you had no troubles with the coding part of the homework.

Looking through the projects:

* I don't think a naive approach with AFL will work (classifying teams
  as winners or losers); maybe if you are lucky you might be able to
  model this as a 2-stage Bayesian network. i.e. Classify teams into
  (say) 'aggressive', 'defensive', 'speedy' and so on. Then ask
  "what's the probability of an aggressive team beating a defensive
  team?"

* Finance: only do it if you are passionate about this
  direction. There are plenty of jobs for quants at finance firms
  (both in Sydney and in New York) -- doing this project could
  guarantee you one if you want it.

* Speech: given about 7 words, it's usually possible to predict the
  8th one. Except when it's a Two Ronnie's sketch. So it might well
  work.

* Traffic: google maps has this data, but I don't think they'll share
  it. It's hard to get at the latent underlying model though.

* Auto-muter: yes, possibly. The volume in ads is higher than in a
  movie, and it is associated with a significant scene change (99% of
  pixels changing from their previous values and a different
  distribution of colours to the previous few seconds). So you could
  learn what is likely to be an ad automatically.

* The school is Cranbrook. They don't have the network data yet, but I
  guess they could put it together for you quickly. If you want to do
  this, we'll need to get started ASAP.
