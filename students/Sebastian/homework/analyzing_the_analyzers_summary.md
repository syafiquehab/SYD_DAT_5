## Analyzing the Analyzers

* This article classifies data scientists into 4 different categories: Data Business people, Data Creatives, Data Developers and Data Researchers. It gives examples of people that fit each of roles, the skills they do and do not have, and how it is easy for a company hiring a data scientist to expect to hire from one category but get applicants from another category.

* The authors perform an informative study where they survey various data scientists and ask them how they rate their skills in various areas that relate to data science (eg maths, statistics, business, software development etc). This gives an interesting profile of the various skills that the different categories of data scientists have.

* The authors emphasize the importance of a "T" shaped data scientists, that is, one that has a broad but somewhat shallow knowledge of data science topics, while also having an in depth knowledge of at least one topic.

* Toward the end of the article, the authors mention the significance of guidance for new data scientists, as well as the importance of setting up data science teams in an organisation. Such environments foster the growth and result of a data scientist.

* The authors use a technique called Non-negative matrix factorization which decomposes a positive matrix as a product of two smaller positive matrices. This is useful in analyzing texts, or in this case survey responses, as it identifies clustering in a collection of texts.
