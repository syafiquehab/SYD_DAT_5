* I'm not 100% sure that I'm looking at the right files for your homework.

* data science handbook homework Ngaire - you have a mixture of HTML
  (<p>) tags and Markdown format tags. I don't know of any markdown
  dialect where this is valid. If you have a blank line between blocks
  of text, that gets turned into a paragraph break normally in
  Markdown.



In the coding part of the homework, you wrote something like this:


    rdm = users.groupby(['occupation','gender','age', 'zip_code'])
    rows = random.sample(rdm, 10)
    rows

You'll find that a dataframe (like `users` in your code) has a method
called .sample() which might have been easier to use.


* I couldn't find your proposed projects.
