#Data Science Handbook chapter summary#
##Pete Skomoroch##
###Principal data scientist at Data Wrangling###

<p>Pete graduated from Brandel University with a double major in physics and maths, then worked for MIT Lincoln, Juice Analytics and Linked In.
He says the creation of the role of the data scientist was to bridge the theory/practice gap between coding engineers and product engineers. It now covers a large number of skill sets and roles.</p>

<p>He was interested in science from a young age and became a research scientist and a research engineer, but, after a talk from Jeff Hammerbacher, talking about a need for a “MacGyver of data analytics” he formed the idea of a role that encompasses coding, analytics and engineering.</p>

<p>He taught himself to develop his programming and computer science skills, largely through “O'Reilly” books, the came across a job at MIT in biodefense.
He would encourage people to stretch themselves and keep coding.
He saw the lack of direction in the early days of data science as an opportunity. He looks for people who are creative and intuitive in trying to find a product that fits the market.</p>

<p>He believes data science will be the thing that drives business decision making. He believes the next biggest thing will be the rise intelligent systems, leveraging off social media. </p>
